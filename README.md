#Tic Tac Toe
This is one of the first projects I created at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.
Why not start out with something fun, right? A game!
Users will be able to play Tic Tac Toe (pass and play) against one another on multiple devices.


## Motivation

I created this game with a precise styling to fit as a feature in order to be included into [The Parisian Flair](http://theparisianflair.com/) which promotes the best of French web.


##Techs Used
- AngularJS framework (along with HTML and CSS)
- Use of a pre-built back-end system (FireBase) for MVP
