# TTT_GAME

This is one of the first projects I created at General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program. 
Users will be able to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against one another. 
The working (pass and play) version of this app is here: https://tpfgametictactoe.firebaseapp.com/

Main techs used:

Javascript
Angular.js
Firebase
